      <p class="para2">During the time I have spent at my current school, I have become involved with numerous groups. I joined a student-formed drama club last school year, and was able to be part of a show in which we performed fifteen short plays in less than half an hour. Close to the end of that school year, I also decided to run for secretary of student council and was voted into the position. As secretary, I have been able to serve this school year by creating announcement slides for morning meeting presentations, managing a committee who is in charge of publicizing school events, and assisting in setup for multiple school events. This school year, I have also been able to become involved with a newly-created eSports club, and recently helped with setup of a game tournament the club held.</p>
