      <h1 class="yes2">School Involvement</h1>
      <p class="para2">During the time I have spent at my current school, I have become involved with numerous groups. I joined a student-formed drama club last school year, and was able to be part of a show in which we performed fifteen short plays in less than half an hour. Close to the end of that school year, I also decided to run for secretary of student council and was voted into the position. As secretary, I have been able to serve this school year by creating announcement slides for morning meeting presentations, managing a committee who is in charge of publicizing school events, and assisting in setup for multiple school events. This school year, I have also been able to become involved with a newly-created eSports club, and recently helped with setup of a game tournament the club held.</p>

      <h1 class="yes2">Education Oportunities</h1>
      <p class="para2">My school has allowed me to accomplish more within the last year than a lot of high school students are able to do in the scope of two years, which has, in turn, allowed me to begin taking dual enrollment college courses this school year.I have also had the opportunity to learn quite a bit about programming while in school, both last year and this year. I have been able to learn about Python and Java, as well as web development using HTML and CSS.</p>
