    <h1 class="yes2">About Me</h1>
    <p class="para2">I'm a quiet individual who enjoys reading, playing piano, and working on small programming projects. One of my favourite hobbies is learning about various computer- and technology-related topics such as file format or applications of hardware. I attend [redacted], and also frequently help my classmates with understanding topics in our courses, especially in math.</p>
    <h1 class="yes2">Education</h1>
    <p class="para2">My school has provided me with the opportunity to be one of very few students able to pursue an Associate's Degree in Computer Science before graduating high school. This has allowed me to accelerate the rate at which I complete certain courses, and as a result, I finished my high school math and science courses in my sophomore year. I am also currently an active member of my school's drama and eSports clubs, as well as secretary of our student council.</p>
